# CommandTrieSearch
> [!WARNING]
> This project started as an autocomplete for the terminal using the Trie data structure to store and search commands. However, as I worked on it, I ended up using a binary tree instead. In hindsight, this was a mistake, as it didnâ€™t align well with the project, I will leave this repo like this and start a new one, because the idea around the binary tree could work on other projects, but not for this one.

This project implements a search system for Linux commands using a Trie data structure. The Trie efficiently stores and retrieves commands based on their prefixes, making it ideal for functionalities like auto-completion and fast command searches.
